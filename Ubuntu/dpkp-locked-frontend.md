## Solved Could not get lock error
The above method would fix the problem for you in most cases. But my case was a bit different. I was updating my system and accidentally closed the terminal. For that reason, there were no processes running apt, but it still showed me the error.

I would advise trying the above two methods or simply restarting your system first. If none of that works, then only you go for this option of removing the lock files.
In this case, the root cause is the lock file. As mentioned earlier, the lock files are used to prevent two or more processes from using the same data. When apt or apt-get commands are run, they create lock files in a few places. If the previous apt command was not terminated properly, the lock files are not deleted and hence they prevent any new instances of apt-get or apt commands.

To fix the problem, all you need to do is to remove the lock files. But before you do that, it would be a good idea to stop any process that is using the lock files.

Use the lsof command to get the process ID of the process holding the lock files. Check the error and see what lock files it is complaining about and get the id of the processes holding these lock files.

Run these commands one by one.
```bash
sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock
sudo lsof /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo lsof /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
```
Itâ€™s possible that the commands donâ€™t return anything, or return just one number. If they do return at least one number, use the number(s) and kill the processes like this (replace the <process_id> with the numbers you got from the above commands):
```bash
sudo kill -9 <process_id>
```
You can now safely remove the lock files using the commands below:
```bash
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
```
After that, reconfigure the packages:
```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```
Now if you run the sudo apt update command, everything should be fine.
